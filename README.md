Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

Cynthia Zhang
Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

1) Introduction/Business Problem
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.
The purpose of this study is to identify potential venues of interest near each neighborhood in Toronto. My audience includes tourists and new residents who want to find fun new places near them. Tourists would want to find new places of attraction to avoid being bored and new residents who might not be familiar with the area would want to find nearby places to have fun. 

2) Downloading and Prepping Data
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

I will use Foursquare location data to execute my idea. I will need to identify the longitude and latitude of each neighborhood as well as venues near these neighborhoods.

3) Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

For this report I used k clusters and map clusters to help tourists and new residents identify venues near each neighborhood. In order to do that I've used folium maps and Foursquare data to identify these neighborhoods and attractions. 

4) Results section where you discuss the results.

Looking at the folium map, we can see that these neighborhoods are located near venues such as Regent Park and Little Portugal that might be of interest to tourists and new residents. 

5) Discussion
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
When I first began this project, I did not expect Toronto neighborhoods to be located near so many interesting venues. 

6) Conclusion
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
This report may be helpful for someone planning on visiting or moving to Toronto, by looking at the attractions near the neighborhoods. However, this report might not cover all variables including access to public transportation, and therefore will not be used as a single decision making tool.
